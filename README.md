This is just a quick side project I did in a few hours to refresh on my Python and Tableau skills. I found the fbref_PL_2024-25.csv file on Kaggle and imported it into a Jupyter notebook to verify and transform the data, creating a Real vs Expected G/A total for the full season and Per 90. I used those transformations to provide a baseline view on the best and worst performing players of the 24/25 Premier League Season. Next, I went into Tableau to showcase the same thing, but also including each player's respective market value throughout the season, thanks to the premier_league_players.csv dataset I also found on Kaggle. I was able to merge the Market value column into the main dataset and create some basic graphs showcasing the 25 best and worst performing players throughout the season by G/A metrics.
